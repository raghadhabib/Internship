# My First Angular Project â€“ ToDo App

This project is **my first hands-on experience with Angular** and represents an important step in my journey to mastering Angular development.

## Project Overview
The application is a **ToDo app** where users can:  
- **Search tasks**: The search feature filters tasks containing the text entered by the user.  
- **Mark tasks as completed**: Clicking on a task toggles its completed status, and the style changes accordingly.  

## Angular Concepts Used
During this project, I applied several core Angular concepts:  
- **Components**: To structure the application and UI.  
- **Directives**: To control DOM behavior and apply conditional styles.  
- **Pipes**: To filter tasks based on user input.  
- **Services**: To manage data and application logic.  
- **HTTP Calls**: Fetching tasks data from an API.

## Notes
- This project is for personal learning and practice.  
- It demonstrates the practical use of Angular features in building a functional web application.

## Running the Project
